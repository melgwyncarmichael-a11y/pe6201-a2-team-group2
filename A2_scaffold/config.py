PE6201 · A2 scaffold — CONFIGURATION
====================================================================
THIS IS THE VENDOR-NEUTRAL BLOCK THE BRIEF ASKS FOR (D5).

Everything that knows which model you are using lives here and in
backend_live.py, and nowhere else. Switching model is changing a string.

    BACKEND = "scripted"   free, deterministic, no key, no network.
                           THIS MUST BE THE DEFAULT IN WHAT YOU SUBMIT.
                           A marker clones your repository and runs it
                           this way. If it does not run, D5(a) fails and
                           Technical Execution is capped.

    BACKEND = "live"       real model through OpenRouter. Costs money.
                           Only D5(b) - your model battery - needs this.

The guardrail checklist (D3b), the reproducible run (D5a) and the two
failure reproductions (D7) ALL run scripted. Only the battery is live.

# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# WHO RESOLVES THE FOUR GATES (Problem B only): the model, or the code.
#
#   "rules"  the four gates (red flag, right department, missing tests,
#            future duplicate) are resolved by tools.resolve_routing() -
#            a pure function over facts the tools already returned. The
#            model is told the resolution and reports it faithfully; it
#            never re-derives the decision. Cheaper, deterministic, and
#            correct on anything the protocol data covers.
#   "model"  the model reads the same raw facts (red_flag_term,
#            right_department, missing_tests, existing_appointments) and
#            applies the routing table itself, in its own reasoning -
#            exactly what the scaffold shipped by default.
#
# BOTH MODES SHARE EVERYTHING ELSE: the same tools, the same guardrails,
# the same gate in front of book_slot. Only who resolves the four gates
# changes. And a THIRD thing runs in BOTH modes unconditionally: a
# route-consistency check (guardrails.py) that silently recomputes the
# resolution and blocks book_slot if the agent's conclusion disagrees
# with it. That check is what makes "model" mode safe to run at all -
# a hostile instruction can talk the model into concluding "book"; it
# cannot make resolve_routing agree, and book_slot is gated on
# agreement, not on what the model said.
